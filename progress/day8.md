# Day 8 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-15

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Built a journal app (journal.py) with write + read functionality
- [x] Built a persistent todo list (todo.py)
- [x] Built a file-backed counter that increments each run (counter.py)

**What I Learned Today:**
- Practiced combining functions with file I/O.
- Learned how `"w"`, `"a"`, and `"r+"` modes affect file behavior.
- Fixed subtle bugs with file pointers (`seek(0)` and `truncate()`).
- Reinforced how to persist state across runs with text files.

**Thoughts:**
I was a bit tired but I wanted to remain on track. I had some problems with counter.py, but it was mostly researching the syntax to make it do what I wanted. Having fun and going strong!

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- File I/O with functions
- String cleanup and formatting
- Working with `datetime`
- State persistence across runs
- Input loops for user interaction

**Next Steps:**
Tomorrow Iâ€™ll work on a larger file-backed project (an address book) to practice CRUD operations before moving on to databases.
