# Day 3 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-10

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Worked on a few small scripts calc.py, greet.py

**What I Learned Today:**
I am still reacquainting myself with Python and taking the time to make sure I have not forgotten any basics. I need to pick up the pace. I will make a bigger push over the next week and gain momentum.

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- Functions (`def`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Modulo Functions
