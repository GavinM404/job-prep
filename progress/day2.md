# Day 2 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-09

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Watched a few videos on Python basics to reacquaint myself with it
- [x] Wrote three Python scripts: tip.py, fizzbuzz.py, even_or_odd.py

**What I Learned Today:**
I am reacquainting myself with Python and taking the time to make sure I have not forgotten any basics. I am feeling pretty hopeful that this is the right direction. I just need to keep my momentum!

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- Input and type conversion (`int`, `float`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Modulo operator (`%`)
