# Day 5 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-12

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Worked on small scripts: dict_inventory.py, grades.py, list_functions.py

**What I Learned Today:**
Today was mostly spent playing with loops and dictionaries. I found the work a little repetitive, but it helped me reacquaint myself with Python syntax and core concepts.

**Thoughts:**
I’m starting to pick up the pace on studying. I supplemented my practice with readings, video study, and an Udemy course. Even if some parts feel basic, I know this foundation will make the harder topics easier later.

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- Functions (`def`) with lists and dictionaries
- Loops (`while`, `for`) for iterating over lists and dicts
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Dictionaries (`{"cat": "dog"}`, `.items()`, `.values()`)

**Next Steps:**
Tomorrow I’ll start working with file I/O (reading and writing to files), which will be the bridge into databases later.
