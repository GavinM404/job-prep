# Day 6 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-13

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Worked on a few scripts: read_numbers.py, write_numbers.py, log_grades.py

**What I Learned Today:**
Woops, almost didn't finish this one. I worked on reading and writing to .txt files. Just a couple of fun little exercises to prepare for working with databases later.

**Thoughts:**
I watched a few videos, worked on my Udemy course, and kept it a relaxed day. Even though I didn’t push hard, I still learned something useful.

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- File I/O (`open`, `readlines`, `write`, `append`)
- String cleanup (`strip()`)
- Functions (`def`) with lists and dictionaries
- Loops (`while`, `for`) for iterating over lists and dicts

**Next Steps:**
Tomorrow (Day 7) I’ll combine file I/O with functions in a mini journaling/logging app.
