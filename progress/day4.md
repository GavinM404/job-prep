# Day 4 Progress

**Date:** 2025-09-11

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Worked on a few small scripts squared.py, shopping_list.py

**What I Learned Today:**
I am still reacquainting myself with Python and taking the time to make sure I have not forgotten any basics. I need to pick up the pace. Work killed me today but I made sure to make some small progress.

**Code Concepts Practiced:**
- Functions (`def`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Booleans (`True/False`)
