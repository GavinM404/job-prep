**What I Learned Today:**
I had a rough experience with a coding camp before, but I’m starting fresh. Inspired by comedian Jimmy Carr — who said, *“Imagine what you would do if you could not fail; that is what you should be doing”* — I’m pursuing a career in backend development or another interesting coding field. Today, I reacquainted myself with Python basics and Git. Tomorrow, I’ll continue with Python and start exploring APIs and small projects.
